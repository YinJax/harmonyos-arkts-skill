# Ark Check

Build a verification manifest from the changed surface and the project's available tooling. DevEco CLI is evidence collection, not a default side effect.

## Plan or Run

1. Classify each changed surface by evidence profile: `local`, `doc-bound`, `config-bound`, or `runtime-bound`.
2. Discover supported test, build, package, install, device, and log commands from project configuration and CLI help; do not copy fixed command lines or SDK paths into the skill.
3. Select the smallest sufficient evidence: focused inspection/test, behavior test with failure path, authorized build, or authorized runtime/device check with observable acceptance criteria.
4. Run builds, packages, installs, emulators, device commands, or log streams only when the user requested that verification scope. Record the exact command/check and result.
5. State every intentional gap as an unverified runtime risk.

## Failure Routing

When evidence fails, do not patch blindly. Route the failure to the command that owns the broken contract:

| Failure signal | Route to | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Render, navigation, decorator, lifecycle, listener, timer, or stale UI completion | `$ark-ui` | The state/lifecycle ledger is incomplete or wrong. |
| Loading, cache, parser, DTO, repository, service, stale request, or error-state issue | `$ark-flow` | The async contract is incomplete or wrong. |
| Permission, API level, Kit behavior, module declaration, native bridge, dependency, or device capability | `$ark-kit` | The capability contract or official constraint is incomplete or wrong. |
| Unknown owner, unexpected file boundary, or unsafe config implication | `$ark-scan` | The project change map is incomplete or wrong. |

## Deliver: Verification Manifest

| Changed surface | Evidence profile | Acceptance criterion | Discovered project command/check | Authorization needed | Result or remaining risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Completion requires every changed surface to have evidence or a named unverified boundary. Read [verification.md](../references/verification.md) when selecting evidence for a mixed-surface change.
